# Ruby Notes

## Dynamic
A dynamic programming language is one that can execute many common programming behaviors at runtime (when the interpreter executes the program) that static programming languages perform during compilation, when a program--the compiler--translates high-level source code to a lower-level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code). Dynamic programming languages can compile code at runtime and execute code during compile-time; the compilation and runtime phases are muddled. Though this flexibility enables meta-programming, more abstraction, and less code, it comes at the expense of execution speed.

Ruby, like most dynamic programming languages, is also dynamically typed. In dynamically typed languages, the language enforces type constraints at runtime; whereas, in statically typed languages, the language enforces type constraints at compile-time. The following method invocation in Ruby runs successfully at runtime:
